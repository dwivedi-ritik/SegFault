what if i tell you that you can make your own netflix server on your home and stream in all of your devices! 

In this article i will explain to you how you can build your own netlix server.

Samba is great tool for setting up local file sharing and streaming platform. To setup samba server on your local network first
you need to install samba on your machine. Depending upon the distro type you can your package manager to install samba.
but for `arch linux` you can use 

```shell
$ sudo pacman -S samba
``` 

once installation done start smaba server using this command.

```shell
$ sudo systemctl start smb 
```

once you see the green `active` symbol you just have to run through following commands.

Back up Samba config file

```shell
$ sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.backup
```

Create new Samba config file

```shell
sudo vim /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

New file (change the items in bold accordingly)

```shell
[global]
server string = File Server
workgroup = LLTV
security = user
map to guest = Bad User
name resolve order = bcast host
include = /etc/samba/shares.conf
```

Create Samba shares config file

```shell
sudo vim /etc/samba/shares.conf
```

New file (change the items in bold accordingly)

```shell
[Public Files]
path = /share/public_files
force user = smbuser
force group = smbgroup
create mask = 0664
force create mode = 0664
directory mask = 0775
force directory mode = 0775
public = yes
writable = yes
 
[Protected Files]
path = /share/private_files
force user = smbuser
force group = smbgroup
create mask = 0664
force create mode = 0664
directory mask = 0775
force directory mode = 0775
public = yes
writable = no
```

Create samba user and group
Create group:

```shell
$ sudo groupadd --system smbgroup
```
Create user:

```shell
$ sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --group smbgroup -s /bin/false smbuser
```
Create shared directories
Create directories:

```shell
$ sudo mkdir -p /share/public_files
$ sudo mkdir /share/private_files
```
Change ownership/permissions:

```shell
$ sudo chown -R smbuser:smbgroup /share
$ sudo chmod -R g+w /share
```
once all this done open up file manager and there you find two folder on network section
`public_files` and `private_files`

just paste all your movies in `public_files`.

now open `vlc media player` on your android phone and make sure your mobile and pc are on same network.
at below of the vlc menu you find your `user_name` just click on it.

then you will find `public_files` and `private_files` folders there. 
just open those up and start streaming ðŸ˜Ž.
