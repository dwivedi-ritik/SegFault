## Setting up proper Github workflow with SSH

As you already know that Github has removed the password authentication 
support on <b>August 13 2021</b>. They have forced their user to use
Personal Access Token instead of password.
But storing and managing access token is very difficult task , No matter
how hard you try to store it. One day you end up creating another one and this cycle never stop.

We don't want to copy paste the long access token just for simple task of pushing our
code to Github. For ease of our task we are going to `ssh` instead of `https`.

But first you have to add a `ssh` key to your Github account but first we to generate one.

### Generating SSH key

- Open up your favorite terminal and type in

```shell
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
 here replace `your_email@example.com` with email which is registered on your github account.

- You will prompted for default file location of key. Just hit enter.

```shell
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/home/you/.ssh/algorithm): [Press enter]
```
- You will get prompted of [passphrase](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/working-with-ssh-key-passphrases) , you can set empty passphrase and just hit enter.

Once thats done you will get your `key fingerprint` but don't copy yet because that will be 
stripped down version of key.

```shell
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/ritik/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/ritik/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /home/ritik/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

- In above result select the key file path , in my case it is `/home/ritik/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`.

- run below command.

```shell
$ cat /home/ritik/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
- Then you find your original key

```shell
$ cat /home/ritik/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxK8475 dwi.ritik20@gmail.com
```
-  copy all the text except `email` part. Your key will look something like this.

`ssh-ed25519 AAAAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxK8475`


### Registering SSH key on Github

- Go to your Github `setting` -> `SSH and PGP` section.
- Click on `New SSH Key`.
- Give a name to your key.
- Paste key in shown box.
- After that save your key.

You have succesfully add `ssh` key in your Github Acccunt.

### Changing remote origin url to ssh

If you have a existing repository which origin url is set on `https` , you can
easily change it to `ssh`.

- Find your repository on github and click `Code` button.
- And select `ssh` and copy the text.
- Text will look something like below text.
```shell
git@github.com:your_user_name/your_repo.git
```
- Now open your `local repository` into terminal.
- Set <b>remote</b> url to ssh


```shell
$ git remote set-url origin git@github.com:your_user_name/your_repo.git
```

- here `origin` is your alias of remote url. It should be your alias of remote url in my case i have set it to "origin".

Now you can easily push your code on Github without worrying about access token.
