### Regular Expression beginner guide for Grep

I always struggle understanding regular expression because of the re cryptic syntax. In the end of this article you surely get better understanding on regular expression. 

- `^`   Matching character must start with characters which are written after .

- `$`   Matching character must end with characters which are writter before .

- `.`   It matches any single character except whitespace.

- `*`   More like wildcard , it matches 0 or more characters. 

- `+`   It matches 1 or more characters.

- `?`   It matches 0 or 1 character.

## 

## Match by range

`[0-9]` we can specified range of numbers for match

```shell
$ echo "181-3443-554" | grep '[0-9]'
```

> **181-3443-554**

it matches each number that comes between 0-9 and including 0 and 1. you can even specify group of particular characters to match  





## Word Boundary

Boundary condition checks that matching regex must be boundary of the word. 

Here boundary means end or start of some word. 

we use `\b` to make boundary condition to match with end of word.

For eg

```shell
$ echo "Avenger Assemble" | grep 'mble\b'
```

output 

>  Avenger Asse**mble**

we can also use `\b` to make boundary condition to match with start of word.

For eg

```shell
$ echo "ahh shit! here we go again" | grep 'ain\b'
```

output 

> ahh shit! here we go ag**ain**
