Guessing game is one of my favorite game whenever i start learning any new programming language. It literary cover all basic concept of
any programming langueges. It cover `loop` , `if-else`, `input` and some logic stuffs. Here in this article will we see how we can make our own guessig game in python and if you keep up with end i have some bonus trick for you ðŸ¤ .

### Lets Start

first we need to make a python file , lets just name it `gussing.py`. Open up your favorite text editor and start typing. first we need to make a lucky num , lets assume that lucky number is '3'.so declare a variable and assign in 3.

```python
lucky_num = 3
```

now we have done that lets just make 3 chance that if user exceeded that limit we will tell him that you lose the game. For that lets make a loop of 3 range and make a `input` function so that user can input his value.

> Do note `input` function return `string` so we have to convert it into a`int` first.

```python
lucky_name = 3
for _ in range(3):
  n = int(input("Enter lucky number: "))
```

now our program is 50% ready to roll but wait how would we verify that given input is equal to the `lucky_num` or not ?
for that there is older but effective method where we use a flag variable for verifying these type of condtions. But wait did we declare a flag ? lol make variable name `flag` and initalize it will `0` and put it before the for loop. After that our code will look like this

```python
lucky_num = 3
#flag variable which declare after
flag = 1
for _ in range(3):
  n = int(input("Enter lucky number: "))

```

now we have to make a condtion that if `n == lucky_num` change flag value to 1 and break the loop.

```python
lucky_num = 3
#flag variable which declare after
flag = 1
for _ in range(3):
  n = int(input("Enter lucky number: "))
  if(n == lucky_num):
    flag = 1
    break
```

how program is nearly done but at last we have to do some formated output so we will make `if-else` statement. if flag is equal to 1 that means user guessed the correct number else he lose.

```python
lucky_num = 3
#flag variable which declare after
flag = 1
for _ in range(3):
  n = int(input("Enter lucky number: "))
  if(n == lucky_num):
    flag = 1
    break
if (flag == 1):
  print("You won")
else:
  print("You lose")
```

### Bonus

i have told you intially that if you stick with me at the end of this article i have some bonus trick and python fact for you so here it is. Do you know python have `for-else` statement ?
let me just show you our program in `for-else`

```python
lucky_num = 3
#flag variable which declare after
flag = 1
for _ in range(3):
  n = int(input("Enter lucky number: "))
  if(n == lucky_num):
    print("You won")
else:
  print("You lose")
```

as you can we have removed `flag`.`for-else` if the foor loop run without any interupt , interupt i mean without going into the condition statment which you written in your program it will then run the else block and if `if-conition` does get executed `for-else` will not execute `else` block.

so here it is folks <i>Guessing game in python</i>.
