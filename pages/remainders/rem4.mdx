## Push your code on Github like Pro

I never liked to type 4 commands each time for pushing your code to github. 

So i have created a alise for that with random commits name.

paste the below code to your default `shellrc` file .

```bash
#Get random gibbrish word

get_random(){
	random_commit=`shuf /usr/share/dict/cracklib-small | awk 'FNR == 1 { print $1 }'`
}
alias gpm='get_random; git add .; git commit -m ${random_commit}; git push origin main'
```

make sure you have file located at `/usr/share/dict/cracklib-small`. For my system Manjaro `cracklib-small` file consists of lots of english dictionary words.
for you system it maybe different.
